# Core Requirements Summary

This short document lists the key behaviors of the TODO Timer Dashboard as described in the project documentation.

- Only **one task** may be active at a time.
- Tasks move between the To‑Do list, Active box and Cleared list using drag and drop.
- Tasks in the To‑Do list can be reordered by dragging.
- Use the `Add new task` field to create tasks, including optional `#tags` and `!` priority flags.
- Each task accumulates time spent active per day. Timers pause at your configured day end and resume the next day.
- The Recap view shows activity for different days via a date picker.
- All tags are shown in a palette. Drag a tag onto a task to assign it, or right‑click a tag to edit its colours.
