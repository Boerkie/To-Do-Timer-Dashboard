# Documents Core Requirements Overview

This overview summarises the main behaviours of the TODO Timer Dashboard as documented in `docs/CORE_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

- Only **one task** can be active at a time.
- Drag tasks between the Toâ€‘Do list, Active area and Cleared list.
- New tasks are added via the `Add new task` field using `#tag` for tags and `!` for priority.
- Each task records how long it has been active today. Timers pause at the configured end of day.
- The Recap view lets you inspect previous days.
- All tags used appear in the Tags panel where they can be assigned to tasks.

See the full requirements in [CORE_REQUIREMENTS.md](CORE_REQUIREMENTS.md).
