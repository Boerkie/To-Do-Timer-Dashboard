# Documents Core Requirements

This README summarizes the primary features for the TODO Timer Dashboard.

- Only **one task** can be active at a time.
- Tasks can be dragged between the Toâ€‘Do list, Active box and Cleared list.
- Add new tasks via the `Add new task` field with optional `#tags` and priority via `!`.
- Each task tracks the time spent active per day.
- Timers pause at the configured end of day and resume at the next start of day.
- Selecting a date in the recap view shows historical activity.
- All tags in use are listed in the Tags panel and can filter or assign tasks.

See [docs/README.md](README.md) for more detail.
