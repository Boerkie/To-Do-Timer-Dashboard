# Core Requirements README

This README summarises the essential features outlined in `CORE_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

- Only one task can be active at any given time.
- Tasks move between Active, To‑Do and Cleared lists via drag and drop.
- Each task supports tags and a priority level cycling from **P4** to **P1**.
- Timers pause automatically at day end and resume the next day.
- Tag and priority filters refine the To‑Do List display.
- The Day Recap provides a timeline view of task activity.

For full details see the complete [CORE_REQUIREMENTS.md](CORE_REQUIREMENTS.md).
