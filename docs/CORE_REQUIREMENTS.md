# Core Requirements

This file outlines the key behaviour enforced by the To‑Do Timer Dashboard.

- Only a single task can be active at any given time.
- Tasks may be dragged between the Active block and the To‑Do List.
- Deactivated tasks reappear at the top of the To‑Do List while new tasks are added to the bottom.
- Each task tracks the amount of time spent on it per day.
- Timers pause automatically at the configured end-of-day and resume the next day.
- Tasks accept optional tags using the `#tag` syntax and priorities marked with `!`.
- Priority values cycle from **P4** (default) through **P1**.
- The dashboard header greets the user using the configured name.
- The Day Recap timeline supports selecting any date to view past activity.
- The Tags List allows filtering tasks and assigning tags via drag and drop.
- A persistent Add Bar remains pinned below the list for quick task creation.
