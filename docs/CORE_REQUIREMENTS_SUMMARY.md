# Core Requirements Summary

This document consolidates the main functional expectations for the **TODO Timer Dashboard**. Detailed explanations live in the other files within this folder.

## Key Points

- A single task may be active at any given moment.
- Tasks support both tags and a priority that cycles from **P4** to **P1**.
- Each task records daily active periods which pause at the configured end of day and resume at the next start of day.
- The Day Recap visualises these periods on a vertical timeline for the selected date.
- Filtering by tag or priority limits visible tasks across all lists.

Refer to `CORE_REQUIREMENTS.md` for the complete description of each feature.
