# To-Do Timer Dashboard

A minimal dashboard for managing a single focus to-do list. Each task gets a
simple timer so you can concentrate on one item before moving on to the next.

## Core Requirements

- Only one task can be active at any given time.
- Each task is associated with a countdown timer.
- When the timer expires, the task should be marked as complete or paused.
- Tasks can be added, removed, and reordered in the list.
