# Documents Core Requirements

This readme summarizes the essential features described in `docs/CORE_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
It mirrors the short list of behaviors for quick reference:

- Only **one task** may be active at any time.
- Tasks can be dragged between the Toâ€‘Do list, the Active box and the Cleared list.
- New tasks are added via the `Add new task` field with `#tags` and priority using `!`.
- Each task tracks time spent active per day; timers pause at day end and resume the next day.
- The Recap view allows selecting another day to inspect past activity.
- All tags used across tasks appear in the Tags panel and can filter or assign tasks.

See [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) for further details.
